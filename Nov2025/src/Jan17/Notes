Encapsulation

Abstraction




problems without abstraction
//right coupling
//cannot switch payment type dynamically
//solid principle - open/closed principle
// client knows implementation details
//class shold be open for extension and close for modification

hide how something is done
expose what needs to be done
enable the loose coupling


abstract class
it does not have a body
No obj
may or maynot have a abs method

// upcasting - reference parent type obj child
Payment cp = new CreditCardPayment();
CreditCardPayment class extends payment

if abstract class has a parameterized constructor then
the class which extends it should have the constructor to initialize the fields which are present in
constructor

=============================================

Interfaces
it is a contract which a implementing class has to fulfill
All the methods in the interface are by default public and abstract
Make use of implements keyword to inherit the interface
It cannot have concrete method
All the variable/data members in the interface are by default puclic, static and final

non-access modifiers-> abstract, static, sync, final

final var-> its value cannot be changed
final method->it cannot be overriden
final class-> it cannot be inherited

can we make abs class as final? -> no we cannot make abs classes final because the class which is supposed to use
the abs class must implement the methods which is not possible if its final

constructor is not allowed in a interface
because constructor is used to initialize the abs class must have values final so no need to initialize
Interface cannot be instantiated


we can implement multiple interfaces in a class
we cannnot extend multiple abs classes
class-> class --extends
class -> interface --implements
interface->interface --extends

-Inner class-> class defined inside a class
