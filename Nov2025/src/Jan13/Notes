## recap

Animal a = new Dog()
Can we override static method? method hiding
we cannot override static method

Runtime polymorphism

this keyword -> current obj

super-> parent obj
it is used to access the parent variables, methods and constructor


In a class if it inherites the super class(extends) then
in the constructor first super classes construtor is called and then the  current
constructor


Encapsulation-> binding of data - methods in a single unit
data hiding to control the class
It can give flexibility and control who access what

why encapsulation
-data protection
-control
-validation


-make fields private use setters and getters to access what required
-this way fields which shouldn't be accessed remain safe


Modifier in java
Access modifier-> public, private, default, protected(visible to package and in subclasses in different package)
non access modifier-> static(belongs to class), synchronized, abstract



Abstraction-> process of hiding the implementation details and showing only necessary fucntionality
to the user
It gives idea what suposed to be done but what you do it depends on child class
there are 2 ways to achieve abstraction
-abstract keyword(0-100%)
-interfaces(100%)

characteristics of abstraction
-no obj can be created for abstract class
-it may
-abstract method exist only in abstract class
