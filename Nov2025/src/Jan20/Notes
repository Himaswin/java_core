Abstraction and interfaces


Abstraction doesnt have a obj

why dont we have a constructor in interface

split
-jvm, jre, jdk
-garbage collection
-serialization/deserialization

Exception ->breaks the normal flow of program.
application issue
Exception handling
can be handled
It is to handle the exception scenarios gracefully to maintain the normal flow of the program

Error-Exception
Error- it is irreversible condition from which you cannot recover
-out of memory
-stackoverflow
it is jvm issue
-cannot be handled
-system crash

Throwable -> parent class of all the exceptions
Exception and error

                Throwable
         Exception      Error

- type of exceptions (interview)
-checked exception(compile time exception)-IoException, InterruptedException
-unchecked exception(runtime exception)-> Artithmetic, NullPointeer

you can have multiple catch in the try catch to handle different exceptions
parent exception should be put at the end

1. JVM detect exception
2. Create exception obj
3. Search for matching catch block
4. Execute the catch

try { risky code
} catch(){
}
finally{} -> will always execute without other catches not execting

try final is allowed
try catch is allowed
three are allowed

why finally? -> used for resource cleanup
DB
exception ->
