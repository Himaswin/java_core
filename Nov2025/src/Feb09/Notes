list vs set
-duplicates vs no duplicates
-order vs may or maynot order

Hashset vs TreeSet
null allowed vs not allowed
Set -- Interface
LinkedHashSet, TreeSet, HashSet -- classes

equals and hashcode makes these to store unique values no duplicates
fail fast vs fail safe iterators
-concurrentmodification exception when we modify the list when we are iterating-- fail fast
-fail safe works on copy of the list so it doesnt show error


Queue -> Linear DS which follows FIFO

InstanceOf operator -> used to check the object type
use -- Typecasting
Upcasting -> converting child to parent reference
Downcasting-> coverting parent to child reference


Maven - Build Automation Tool, build our code into 1 single file, manages dependecies
Gradle

Lombok -> It is a library-buch of different classes
-It is used to reduce the boilerplate code
boilerplate code - non business logic code

Using lombok
for getters @Getter
for setter @Setter                  --------------------> all these can be called by using @Data
for to string @ToString
for equals and hashcode @EqualsAndHashCode

for parameterized constructor @AllArgsconstructor
for normal constructor @NoArgsConstructor


pom.xml - in a maven project it is generated
-also has plugins
-It will create .m2  folder and download all the dependecies from there

Builder design pattern

-Solid principle


Maven lifecycle -> clean install test

Map-> Not part of collection interface but part of collections framework

Interface with key value pair Map<K, V>
-key must be unique
-value can be duplicate

Framework -- is formed combining bunch of libraries

HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, concurrentHashMap

-put, get, containsKey
loop over map -> entrySet, keySet

Arraylist is not threadsafe since it is not syncronized
